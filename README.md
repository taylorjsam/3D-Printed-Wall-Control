üõ†Ô∏è Custom Tool Hangers for Wall Control Pegboard

This repository contains a growing collection of 3D-printable custom tool holders designed specifically for Wall Control pegboard systems (metal pegboard with slotted mounting holes). These hangers are tailored for various tools and accessories ‚Äî from calipers and screwdrivers to highly specific tool geometries.

Metal Small WC Hook Hangers/

These models are designed to use the small metal Wall Control hooks (10-HS-001) that are inserted into the back of the print. The holder portion is 3D-printed and provides the form-fitting rest or clamp for the specific tool:
	‚Ä¢	Ideal when you want the strength and reliability of steel engagement with the board.
	‚Ä¢	Faster print time since hooks are not printed.
	‚Ä¢	Just insert the metal hook into the designated cavity in the print and it should snap into place.

These are perfect for medium to heavy-weight tools.

Printed Snap Hook Hangers/

These models are designed to use the 3D-printable hook inserts, allowing for fully printed hangers:
	‚Ä¢	Current Version: Gen 4
	‚Ä¢	Toolless snap-in installation.
	‚Ä¢	Injection slot included for glue if additional reinforcement is desired.
	‚Ä¢	Zero-clearance fit to minimize movement once mounted.
	‚Ä¢	Optimized to align tightly within the Wall Control slot geometry.

These are perfect for lightweight to medium-weight tools where full-print integration makes sense.

üß∞ Tool Compatibility

Each tool holder is generally named for the tool it fits, such as:
	‚Ä¢	Park Tool HMR-4
	‚Ä¢	Olsa Flat Pick 3pc
	‚Ä¢	Vessel Megadora 6pc
	‚Ä¢	Caliper Holder (generic)
	‚Ä¢	Wera Hex Plus Allen Set
	‚Ä¢	Knipex 250mm Pliers Wrench


Some holders are generic and multipurpose (e.g., caliper or utility hangers), while others are precision-contoured for exact fits based on STL scans or manual measurements.

üî© Assembly Notes
	For Printed Snap Hook versions:
	‚Ä¢	Insert the snap hooks into the back of the tool holder ‚Äî they lock in place via compression and geometry. (Once inserted hook is NOT removable from holder)
	‚Ä¢	Optionally inject a small amount of superglue or epoxy through the glue port.
	‚Ä¢	Thumb tab at the bottom allows for easy installation and removal from wall.
	For Metal WC Hook versions:
	‚Ä¢	Simply press the Wall Control metal hook into the back cavity until fully seated.
	‚Ä¢	Hook is removable but holders are designed to allow installation onto the wall without removal
	Note about warping: On some printers or with certain materials, the longer pieces may be prone to warping. To address this, I‚Äôve included hook mounts both near the center and near the edges. Only two hooks are recommended for these pieces with 4 placement options. If no warping is present, I recommend using the outer mounts as they provide slightly stronger support. However, if any warping is observed, use the inner mounts instead. Attempting to use the outer mounts with a warped piece may shear off the hooks, as they cannot be inserted straight when the part is bent.

üôå Contributions

I‚Äôm actively refining existing holders and designing new ones as I add tools to my collection. The Gen 4 snap hook system is the most current and reliable release ‚Äî featuring tight tolerance fits, toolless installation, and optional glue injection points for reinforcement. I am also adding need tools as I acquire them and as I have time.

Got a tool you‚Äôd like a hanger for? Submit a request or fork the repo and contribute your own design! If you‚Äôre submitting a pull request, please make sure to test the holder with the actual tool first ‚Äî the goal is to keep all shared designs accurate, functional, and ready for real-world use without modification.
